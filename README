Lab 3B

*** Files 
- Makefile: Targets for building the project
    * default Builds the lab3b bash script which runs the lab3b.py file
    * clean   Removes bash script files and tarballs created from the Makefile
    * dist    Creates a distribution tarball containing the project files
- README: Project description, notes, and sources 
- lab3b.py: Program file to script that detects error in Lab3a binary output CSV
    
*** Notes
- The project assumes that there is only one block group in the original image file
  before being processed by the lab3a binary. 
  This assumption comes from the project specifications and allows for minor simpliciations
  to the program.
