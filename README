Lab 3A

*** Files 
- Makefile: Targets for building the project
    * default Builds the lab3a binary from lab3a.c and ext2_fs.h 
    * clean   Removes binary files and tarballs created from the Makefile
    * dist    Creates a distribution tarball containing the source files
- README: Project description, notes, and sources 
- lab3a.c: Source file for program that processes EXT2 image files 
- ext2_fs.h: Contains structure definitions of various data structures used 
    in the EXT2 system implementation
    
*** Notes
- The project assumes that there is only one block group in the file.
  This assumption comes from the project specifications and discussion
  section's explanation of the project.
- The location of the superblock and group descriptor were hard to 
  understand at first when reading through the description of the EXT2
  file system structure. An interesting note is that the group descriptor 
  can be both in the zeroth block group or the first block group depending
  on the size.
- Using mkfs.ext2, the program has been tested to also work on systems
  where the block size is larger than 1kb, which was a limitation of the
  trivial.img and ext2_test.img given for testing.
